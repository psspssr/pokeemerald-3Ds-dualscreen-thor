Pokémon Emerald 3Ds Dual Screen brings the adventure to Nintendo 3DS as
**native homebrew**. The game runs on the top screen, while a dedicated touch
interface on the bottom screen replaces the START menu. Enable the optional
**voxel overworld** to explore supported areas from a new angle.

## Features

| | What to expect |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native 3DS homebrew** | Runs directly on the console's ARM11 using libctru, Citro2D and Citro3D, without an emulator. |
| **Two screens, one adventure** | The game on top, with a dedicated touch interface below in place of the START menu. |
| **Optional voxel overworld** | Modelled buildings, trees, signposts and terrain relief, with adjustable camera angle and zoom. |
| **Built from your own cartridge** | The builder generates the game data locally from your own dump. No ROM content is distributed. |

### A new perspective on Hoenn

The voxel overworld is **off by default**. Open **OPTION** on the bottom
screen and enable **VOXEL 3D**, then adjust **3D ANGLE** and **3D ZOOM** to
set your camera.

> **3D mode is a work in progress.** Only some buildings, trees, signposts
> and terrain relief are modelled today. Most of the map and nearly all
> interiors are still shown flat. More areas will be modelled as the
> project moves forward.

## Getting started

### What you need

- A **Nintendo 3DS / 2DS family console** with custom firmware (Luma3DS)
  and the Homebrew Launcher.
- A **clean dump of your own Pokémon Emerald (USA, Europe) cartridge**.
- Your console's **SD card**, connected to your computer.

Supported ROM SHA-1:

```text
f3ae088181bf583e55daf962a92bb46f4f1d07b7
```

### Install on Windows

1. Download `Emerald3DS-vX.Y.Z-Windows.zip` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/ZallaxDev/pokeemerald-3Ds-dualscreen/releases/latest)
   and extract the whole ZIP.
2. Run `Emerald3DS-Builder.exe`, choose your ROM and your SD card, press
   **Install**.
3. Make sure `SD:/3ds/dspfirm.cdc` is present for sound, put the SD card back
   in your console and launch **Pokémon Emerald 3Ds Dual Screen** from the
   Homebrew Launcher.

For the complete walkthrough, including sound setup and updates, see the
**[installation guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md)**.

The builder writes `/3ds/emerald3ds/Emerald3DS.3dsx`, `Emerald3DS.smdh` and
`emerald3ds.pak`. The ROM is only read: it is not copied, uploaded or modified,
and the builder needs no Internet connection.

**Updating?** Run the new release's builder again to generate a matching
data pack. The game tells you if the pack does not match the release.
Installing or updating does not overwrite your save.

<details>
<summary><strong>Linux and macOS installation</strong></summary>

Run the builder from source with **Python 3.11+ and Pillow**, using the
`payload/` folder from the matching release ZIP:

```sh
python -m emerald3ds_builder --payload /path/to/payload install --rom /path/to/rom.gba --sd /path/to/card
```

See the [builder documentation](builder/) for setup and additional commands.

## About this repository

**This repository contains no game content.** It holds the port's own code,
the tools that build it and the builder that turns *your own* cartridge dump
into the game's data pack. Nothing derived from the ROM is distributed here or
in the releases.

| Component | Location | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Engine | [pret/pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) · [`upstream.lock`](upstream.lock) | The Pokémon Emerald decompilation, pinned to a specific revision. |
| Port patches | [`patches/pokeemerald/`](patches/pokeemerald) | The port's changes to the upstream engine. |
| 3DS backend | [`3ds_port/`](3ds_port) | ARM11 backend, GPU compositor, NDSP audio, touch UI and voxel overworld. |
| Data builder | [`builder/`](builder/) | Creates the data pack locally from the player's own supported ROM. |

## Building from source

```sh
python tools/bootstrap.py        # pinned upstream + patches + port -> build/upstream
python tools/bootstrap.py --make # also builds the 3DSX there
```

Start with the [development guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for requirements,
the development loop, loose data, data packs and host tests.
