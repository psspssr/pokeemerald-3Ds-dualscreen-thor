Pokémon Emerald 3Ds Dual Screen
===============================

A native Nintendo 3DS port of Pokémon Emerald that uses both screens.

This download does NOT contain the game. You need your own dump of your own
Pokémon Emerald (USA, Europe) cartridge. The builder reads that ROM on this
computer and generates the game's data pack from it. The ROM is not uploaded,
copied or modified, and no Internet connection is needed.

What you need
-------------
- A Nintendo 3DS / 2DS family console with custom firmware (Luma3DS) and the
  Homebrew Launcher.
- A clean ROM of Pokémon Emerald (USA, Europe),
  SHA-1 f3ae088181bf583e55daf962a92bb46f4f1d07b7.
- The console's SD card in this computer (or any folder, to copy by hand).

Install
-------
1. Extract this whole ZIP to a folder.
2. Run Emerald3DS-Builder.exe.
3. Choose your ROM. The builder checks that it is the supported one.
4. Choose your SD card (it is detected when it has a "Nintendo 3DS" folder)
   or any folder.
5. Press Install. It writes:
       /3ds/emerald3ds/Emerald3DS.3dsx
       /3ds/emerald3ds/Emerald3DS.smdh
       /3ds/emerald3ds/emerald3ds.pak
6. Put the card back in the console and start Pokémon Emerald 3Ds Dual Screen from the
   Homebrew Launcher.

Saves are kept in /3ds/emerald3ds/emerald3ds.sav. Reinstalling or updating
never touches it.

Command line
------------
    emerald3ds-builder-cli.exe build   --rom "Pokemon Emerald.gba" --output out
    emerald3ds-builder-cli.exe install --rom "Pokemon Emerald.gba" --sd E:\
    emerald3ds-builder-cli.exe verify  --pak E:\3ds\emerald3ds\emerald3ds.pak

Updating
--------
Each release comes with its own builder. Run the new builder again with the
same ROM: a data pack only works with the release that generated it, and the
game tells you when they do not match.
