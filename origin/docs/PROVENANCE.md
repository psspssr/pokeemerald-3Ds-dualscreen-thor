# Provenance

Where every part of Pokémon Emerald 3Ds Dual Screen comes from, and what ships where.

## Rules the tooling enforces

- `tools/release_audit.py --strict` fails on ROMs, saves, packs, logs,
  bytecode, agent state, validation captures, generated RomFS content, local
  paths, secrets, untracked large files, media without an entry in
  `tools/release_audit_allow.toml`, and (with `--rom`) any run of the ROM's
  bytes in any file or release archive.
- `tools/gen_recipe.py` fails when more than a small, classified amount of
  the original game's own objects would have to travel as literal bytes.
- Samples: the release uses the cartridge's original samples, built by
  pret's `wav2agb` pipeline. Replacement samples are only possible through
  `SAMPLE_OVERLAY_DIR` in a local build.
