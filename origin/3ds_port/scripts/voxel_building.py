"""Buildings rebuilt in 3D from their own drawing, pixel for pixel.

The premise
-----------
An Emerald building is drawn in a fixed oblique projection: a wall is seen
face on and the ground straight from above, both at one pixel per pixel. That
is exactly what an orthographic camera pitched at 45 degrees sees (scaled by
sqrt 2). A point (X, Y, Z) of the world - X east, Y up, Z south, in pixels -
lands on the art at

    u = X        v = Z - Y

so the drawing is not a texture to be wrapped around a guessed box: it is the
model seen from one direction. Every surface is textured by that fact - one
art texel per GBA pixel seen across the surface at 45 degrees, `density_check`
proves it for every triangle - so nothing is ever stretched or squashed, and
`ortho_check` renders the model in the GBA projection and compares it pixel
for pixel with the art over the regions a spec declares exact.

The drawing is shallower than the building. Emerald draws a four-row house in
five rows of art, which read literally gives a house two tiles deep. A model
keeps the real footprint (the collision) and covers the depth the drawing
lacks the way the building would: more courses of the same roof tiles, more
plaster from the same column (`Strip`, `Tile`). What the drawing never shows -
the sides, the back - is dressed from the same art. No new pixels are painted
and nothing depends on the game's camera, so the model stays right at any
pitch or yaw.

The ground
----------
Emerald paints the ground under a building's edges into the building's own
metatiles. A pixel belongs to the building when its top layer is opaque or
when its bottom-layer 8x8 tile is not one of the ground tiles around it. The
rest is transparent in the model's texture, and the cells the building covers
get the plain ground metatile drawn flat underneath instead.

Modelling vocabulary
--------------------
  Proj     a wall placed at its drawn depth: u = X, v = Z - Y, exactly.
  Strip    courses laid up a face from its eave: the drawn eave rows, then
           repeats of a clean course, at the 45-degree density.
  Tile     an art rectangle repeated 1:1 (side walls, corner posts).
  Prism    a (Z, Y) polygon extruded over X; its edges take Proj/Strip/Tile,
           its two end caps are tiled by Bands.
  HipRoof  a hipped roof with ridge teeth and cap, all four slopes tiled.
  Frustum  walls on any convex plan, a sloped roof band and a flat top
           (the octagonal Pokemon Center and Mart).
  Cylinder a short round thing (a vent), projected where it is drawn.
  Vault    a barrel vault on a flat top (the Pokemon Center's crown).
  Walls    walls along an open plan, projected (a chamfered porch).
  Relief   a solid read column by column off its drawing (hedges, walls).
  Mound    a rounded rock: every drawn pixel lifted onto its own dome.

    A roof is drawn as a few courses of tiles, fewer than a roof of the
    building's real depth needs. Rather than stretch them, the face is built
    the way a roof is: the eave course the art draws (`fixed`, rows [a, b),
    bottom row at the eave) and then as many more courses as the depth takes,
    repeating rows [c, d) of the same art upwards, starting at row `start`
    (default d - 1) so the pattern continues exactly where the fixed rows end.
    With no `repeat` the last fixed row is held (a face the art hides).

    Along the face the art is laid at cos(b) + sin(b) texels per pixel, b the
    face's pitch: the density at which a texel covers exactly one pixel seen
    from 45 degrees across its eave, as the GBA draws every surface. Walls
    and flat tops are then 1:1, and a 45-degree slope is sqrt 2 - which is
    what the drawing's own projection gives it.

    `wrap` = (lo, hi) samples u from that column range only, cyclically, for
    art whose edges are not the material (a verge, a neighbour). Keep hi - lo a
