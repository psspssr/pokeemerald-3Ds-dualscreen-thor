"""Terrain relief read off the drawing: cliffs, their stairs, rocks at sea.

The premise is the one voxel_building.py builds on: the GBA draws the world
in a 45-degree oblique projection, a point (X, Y, Z) of it landing on the art
at u = X, v = Z - Y. Turned round, a height h(u, v) for every point of the
art places that point at

    (u, h, v + h)

and for ANY choice of h the GBA view of the result is the drawing itself,
pixel for pixel. So terrain is not built of boxes: the art is laid as a sheet
and lifted, and the only question is how high each point of it is.

How high
--------
The cartridge does not say - a plateau and the beach below it share an
elevation - but the drawing does, because in an oblique view a cliff is only
ever seen from the front or from the side:

  * land splits into regions at the rock bands (roles `cliff` and `shelf`)
    and at the stairs through them;
  * a band with land to its north and land to its south, of different
    regions, is a south-facing face: the north region stands one level above
    the south one. Contradictions (a fence line between one wood) are simply
    not constraints;
  * water stands at the lowest land it touches, and a level below any land
    it only reaches across a rock band (a sea cliff facing west or east).

One level is one tile - the rock band is drawn one cell tall. Heights live on
a lattice every 4 pixels. Land and water fix it; the rock and stair cells in
between are solved harmonically, which makes a south face exactly vertical (h
falls one pixel per row, so v + h is constant down it), a west or east face a
45-degree slope (the diagonal striations the artist drew) and every corner of
the staircase a smooth turn - never a square block. A rock mass with no higher
land beside it (a rock at sea) is raised as a mound by its distance from the
water.

Ledges
------
Every outdoor map's ledges are lifted the same way, on maps whose cliffs
are not solved as well: the brown lip, told from the ground round it by its
colours, rises
from its foot on the jump side to LIP pixels at its top edge, and the ground
behind rises to meet it, a low berm facing where the jump goes. Corner cells
jump two ways and take the nearer foot; the junction pieces where a ledge
steps are ledge too; a lip comes down to the ground where the ledge ends.

# ── mountains read off the drawing ──────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The mountains of the General tileset (Route 116, Verdanturf, ...) are drawn
# terrace upon terrace, and their tops, faces and rims are told apart by their
# colours, not by the cell they are in: most of their metatiles are part top,
# part face. So these maps are read pixel by pixel.
#
#   * a pixel is top, face, rim (the pale edge a terrace is drawn with where it
#     rises from the one north of it: its own face, turned north, is hidden),
#     ground (anything else: grass, trees, houses), or free (stairs);
#   * tops and grounds are regions, 4-connected, each of its own kind;
#   * down a column, a face between two regions is a south face: seen straight
#     on at 45 degrees it is drawn as tall as it is, so the region above stands
#     exactly as many pixels higher as the face is long. A rim is a step of
#     RIM_RISE up to the south;
#   * the levels are the least-squares answer to all of that, weighed by how
#     many columns say it, the ground at the maps' open edges held at 0. Runs
#     that disagree with the answer (a west or east face read down its length)
#     are dropped and it is solved again;
#   * levels are whole levels (every face is drawn one level tall);
#   * the shape is laid cell by cell, since the art is drawn in whole cells:
#     a cell mostly top or mostly ground is a footprint at its region's level
#     (a ledge a cell wide between bands counts its level across them); the
#     rest - faces, bands, corners, stairs - is rock, one level per cell,
#     hung from the cell it is drawn below (see the tile pass). A tile
#     repeated is the same plane all along, so every edge is a straight line
#     where the drawing's is, parallel to the next; the rim's drawn wobble
#     stays in the texture, and grass is never bent. `--proof` draws it.
#
# Maps drawn across a seam are solved on one canvas, placed as they connect,
# so the mountain is one mountain on both sides of it.
