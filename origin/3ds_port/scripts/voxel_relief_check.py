"""The mountains' geometry checked against what a 45-degree drawing allows.

gen_voxel_relief.py lifts every point of the art to (u, h, v + h): seen at
45 degrees the result is the drawing whatever h is, so the drawing alone
never shows a wrong height - the game's camera does. Each tile of rock has
one shape the drawing means, and between two lattice points (4 pixels) a
surface can only be one of:

    across a row (u)    |dh| <= 4   flat to a band's 45-degree slope; more is
                                    the texture stretched sideways ("stretch")
    down a column (v)   -4 <= dh <= 0   a vertical south face to flat; a rise
                                    southward is a slope turned north, which
                                    the drawing never shows ("north"); a fall
                                    of more than a pixel a pixel leans out
                                    over its foot ("overhang")
    a quad              its four corners on one plane, within 4 px; more is
                                    a crease across the tile ("twist")

A wall a level tall within one lattice step, either way (a cap's end over
the sea, a rim's hidden riser, the outline of a rock against the water) is
the silhouette the drawing has, as Route 116's rims are, and is not counted:
what is counted is a slope the drawing does not draw, the texture spread
over it.

Route 116 is the reference: its mountains are what the tiles mean, and the
check is that every other map is as clean, cell by cell.

The workflow for a map: list its flagged cells (--list), look at them
through the camera (--view), change the tile pattern in gen_voxel_relief.py
(never a single map), and run it again --against the run before: Route 116
must not get worse, and no cell anywhere should.

`--images` draws each group's art with every flagged cell boxed (red severe,
orange mild) and its score, to read the faults off the tiles.
