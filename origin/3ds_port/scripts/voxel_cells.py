"""What every cell of a layout is, for the voxel generators.

The cartridge answers most of it itself: the behaviour byte says water,
ledges and doors; the blockdata says what is blocked and at which elevation;
the maps' own events say where the doors (warps) and the signs are, and the
map type says whether it is outdoors. The drawing is only asked what the
data does not state: whether a blocked cell is drawn as foliage, and whether a
walkable one is drawn as steps.

Roles, in the order they are decided:

    water     a water behaviour
    ledge     a jump behaviour
    stair     walkable and drawn as steps (Layout.treads)
    floor     any other walkable cell
    signpost  an outdoor post: blocked, open on three sides (a sign, a lamp)
    wall      part of a building: the blocked mass above a house door
    tree      blocked and drawn mostly in foliage
    fence     blocked, one cell thin, walkable on both sides
    cliff     blocked terrain touching walkable ground
    shelf     blocked terrain away from walkable ground
    prop      nothing of the above
