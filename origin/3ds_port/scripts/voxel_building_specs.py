"""Building models, one reading of the drawing per building type.

Each spec names where a reference copy of the building sits (layout and cell
rectangle), which metatiles are the ground around it, the parts that rebuild
it, and the art rectangles the model must reproduce pixel for pixel when it
is rendered in the GBA's projection. Row numbers are art rows of that
rectangle.

Littleroot's houses
-------------------
The two houses are the same building. The drawing, from the top:

    rows  1- 8  upper ridge cap       rows 17-24 lower ridge cap  (the "ears")
    rows  9-15  upper ridge teeth     rows 25-31 lower ridge teeth
    rows 16-35  upper roof, 5 courses rows 32-51 lower roof, 5 courses
    rows 36-37  upper fascia          rows 52-53 lower fascia
    rows 38-44  upper storey wall     rows 54-79 ground floor facade

The ears are the same ridge and the same courses as the upper roof, sixteen
rows lower: a full-width lower roof, and a narrower upper storey that comes up
through it with its own roof.

The drawing is shallower than the house. Taken literally (every band at the
depth the 45-degree projection gives it) the house would be two tiles deep,
while it stands on four rows of collision. So the model keeps the real
footprint, and the depth the drawing does not have is covered the way a roof
covers it - with more courses of the same tiles (Strip), never with stretched
ones. The facade, the pent roof in front of the upper storey, the upper wall
and the upper roof's first four courses stay exactly the drawing; only the
roofs grow, by the courses the depth needs.

Both roofs are hipped: seen from the side they are tiles too, laid along the
side eave, so no gable wall of plaster ever shows.
