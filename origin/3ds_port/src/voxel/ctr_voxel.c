/*
 * Voxel overworld on Citro3D.
 *
 * This is the only file of the voxel module that knows what a GPU is. It owns
 * the shader, the metatile atlas textures, the chunk cache in VRAM, the staging
 * buffers and the matrices; the map, the camera, the atlas composition and the
 * geometry come from the SDK-free modules beside it.
 *
 * Frame ownership is unchanged: CtrVideo_Present() opens and closes the one
 * Citro3D frame, and nothing here calls C3D_Init, C3D_FrameBegin or
 * C3D_FrameEnd. Update() runs inside the open frame, after FrameBegin has
 * waited for the previous frame's GPU work, so every staging buffer written
 * last frame is free again when it starts.
 *
 * What an Old 3DS can afford decides the shape of everything below:
 *
 *   - nothing is rebuilt, re-hashed or re-read on a frame where nothing
 *     changed. A frame that only walks costs the draw calls and the billboards;
 *   - the work that does come - a chunk entering the view, an atlas, a
 *     building page - is spent against a time budget measured from the frame
 *     itself, nearest first, and done ahead of time when the frame has room;
 *   - no file is read on the render thread while the game waits for it.
