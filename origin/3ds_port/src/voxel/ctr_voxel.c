/*
 * Voxel overworld on Citro3D.
 *
 * This is the only file of the voxel module that knows what a GPU is. It owns
 * the shader, the metatile atlas textures, the chunk cache in VRAM, the staging
 * buffers and the matrices; the map, the camera, the atlas composition and the
 * geometry come from the SDK-free modules beside it.
 *
 * Frame ownership is unchanged: CtrVideo_Present() opens and closes the one
 * Citro3D frame, and nothing here calls C3D_Init, C3D_FrameBegin or
 * C3D_FrameEnd. Update() runs inside the open frame, after FrameBegin has
 * waited for the previous frame's GPU work, so every staging buffer written
 * last frame is free again when it starts.
 *
 * What an Old 3DS can afford decides the shape of everything below:
 *
 *   - nothing is rebuilt, re-hashed or re-read on a frame where nothing
 *     changed. A frame that only walks costs the draw calls and the billboards;
 *   - the work that does come - a chunk entering the view, an atlas, a
 *     building page - is spent against a time budget measured from the frame
 *     itself, nearest first, and done ahead of time when the frame has room;
 *   - no file is read on the render thread while the game waits for it.

 * ── The draft of a square ──────────────────────────────────────────────────

 * A square the view needs and has not got is a hole, and a hole is black. Its
 * real build is 10-30 ms of lighting rays, trees and models on an Old 3DS - a
 * dozen frames of the time the frames can spare - so on a crossing, or round a
 * bend at a run, the player was on the ground before the ground was.
 *
 * The draft is what the square looks like without any of that: every cell's
 * own drawing, flat, unlit (VoxelMesh_DraftCell). A few hundred microseconds,
 * packed straight into the frame's staging and uploaded in the same frame the
 * hole is found, so nothing is ever drawn black where there is a map. It is
 * marked, and asked for again as an ordinary stale square: the real build
 * replaces it as soon as the frames have the time, drawn meanwhile as it is.
 *
 * It reads nothing of the build that may be running - the scratch, the
 * builder, the classification window are that job's - so it never waits for
 * it and never cancels it.

 * frame, however much of it the CPU still had - it was waiting for the GPU.
 *
 * So the building runs after FrameEnd (CtrVoxel_AfterSubmit), in the time the
 * CPU used to spend waiting for the VBlank while the GPU drew, against what
 * is left of the frame once the game and the audio have had their share.
 * Inside the frame there is only what cannot move out of it: the uploads of
 * what was finished (a GPU copy is queued in an open frame), a little after a
