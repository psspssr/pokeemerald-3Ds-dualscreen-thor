/*
 * Buildings modelled from their own drawing.
 *
 * voxel/buildings.bin is written by scripts/gen_voxel_buildings.py,
 * which reads every building off its art (voxel_building.py explains how) and
 * refuses to write a model that does not reproduce that art pixel for pixel
 * in the GBA's projection. The console does no modelling: it copies each
 * placed model's triangles into the chunk that holds its top-left cell, draws
 * the plain ground under every cell the model covers, and keeps the region
 * table's generic extrusion away from those cells.
 *
 * The models carry their own texture - the building's art with the ground
 * made transparent, paged by map - so they are drawn in their own
 * alpha-tested pass.
