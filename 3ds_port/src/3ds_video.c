 * - skyRows: the speech's sky, the first rows of its background, drawn from
 *   the top of the screen rather than the top of the picture, so it starts at
 *   the top-left corner and carries on to the right as the rest does.
 * - band: the text box of the professor's speech (BG0 from bandRow down)

 *   (menu.c, sStandardTextBox_WindowTemplates, and CTR_FIELD_UI_SHIFT). It

 * margins are new art made for them (scripts/gen_intro_margins.py): every
 * shape the edge cuts carried on from the edge's own pixels and closed, new
 * grass, bushes, plants and hills behind, and the plants layer's darker first
 * eight columns - the GBA screen's edge, where the pit ends - drawn anew. It
 * is made by the builder from the player's ROM, like the voxel data, and read
 * here from stage/leaves.bin: per layer the colour above the map's first row
 * and two strips of palette entries, 64x256 on the left (screen x -56..7) and
 * 56x256 on the right (x 240..295), a row per map row.
 *
 * Each strip becomes a texture of the current palette, remade when a palette
 * the scene uses changes (the fades in and out), and is drawn beside the
 * picture moving with the layer's scroll, faded like any stage margin. Above
 * and below the picture the layers' own rows show - the art the GBA scrolls
 * in as the scene pans - and above the sky's first row, its colour.
 *
 * The scene is known by its backgrounds' control registers (intro.c,
 * Task_Scene1_Load): four 256x512 4bpp maps on character base 0 at screen
 * bases 16, 18, 20 and 22, BG n at priority n.

 *   drawn to the screen in bands of lines that share those.
 * - Their own picture: BG0, their sprites and the backdrop wherever their
 *   windows hide the field. Composed like any GBA screen, band by band of
 *   lines whose registers match (sLineRegs), at 2x into the battle scene's
 *   surface and drawn from it at 0.75 with filtering, as the battle scene
 *   is. 160 lines at 2x do not fit its 256, so the two halves of the picture
