# Install and update Pokémon Emerald 3Ds Dual Screen

These instructions apply to the latest
[release](https://github.com/ZallaxDev/pokeemerald-3Ds-dualscreen/releases/latest).
Download the ZIP attached to the release, not the automatically generated
source-code archives.

The download **does not contain the game**. You need a clean dump of your own
Pokémon Emerald (USA, Europe) cartridge. The builder generates the game's data
pack locally from your ROM; it does not upload, copy or modify the ROM, and it
needs no Internet connection.

## What you need

- A Nintendo 3DS / 2DS family console with custom firmware (Luma3DS) and the
  Homebrew Launcher.
- A clean Pokémon Emerald (USA, Europe) ROM with SHA-1
  `f3ae088181bf583e55daf962a92bb46f4f1d07b7`.
- Your console's SD card connected to your computer, or a folder whose
  contents you can copy to the root of that card.

## Install on Windows

1. Download `Emerald3DS-vX.Y.Z-Windows.zip` from the release and extract the
   **whole** ZIP to a folder.
2. Run `Emerald3DS-Builder.exe` from the extracted folder.
3. Select your ROM. The builder checks that it is the supported version.
4. Select the root of your SD card (automatically detected if it contains a
   `Nintendo 3DS` folder), or select another folder.
5. Press **Install**. The builder writes these files under the selected destination:

   ```text
   3ds/emerald3ds/Emerald3DS.3dsx
   3ds/emerald3ds/Emerald3DS.smdh
   3ds/emerald3ds/emerald3ds.pak
   ```

6. If you selected a folder instead of the SD card, copy its `3ds` folder to
   the **root** of your SD card, merging it with the existing `3ds` folder.
7. Make sure `SD:/3ds/dspfirm.cdc` is present for sound (see below). Put the
   card back in the console and launch **Pokémon Emerald 3Ds Dual Screen** from
   the Homebrew Launcher.

### Sound

Audio requires `dspfirm.cdc` at **`SD:/3ds/dspfirm.cdc`**, directly inside the
SD card's `3ds` folder, **not** inside `3ds/emerald3ds/`. This file is not
included with the release. If it is missing, the game may otherwise run
normally but without sound.

## Update an existing installation

1. Download and extract the **new release's** Windows ZIP.
2. Run its `Emerald3DS-Builder.exe` with your ROM and the same SD card (or
   another folder to copy to the card). Press **Install** again.
3. If you installed to a folder, copy its `3ds` folder to the root of the SD
   card as above. Launch the updated game from the Homebrew Launcher.

Each release has its own builder. Always regenerate `emerald3ds.pak` with the
builder from the release you are installing: a data pack only works with its
matching game version, and the game will tell you if they do not match. Your
save is stored at `SD:/3ds/emerald3ds/emerald3ds.sav`; installing or updating
does not overwrite it.

## Command line and other systems

The Windows ZIP also includes `emerald3ds-builder-cli.exe`:

```text
emerald3ds-builder-cli.exe build   --rom "Pokemon Emerald.gba" --output out
emerald3ds-builder-cli.exe install --rom "Pokemon Emerald.gba" --sd E:\
emerald3ds-builder-cli.exe verify  --pak E:\3ds\emerald3ds\emerald3ds.pak
```

On Linux and macOS, run the builder from source with Python 3.11+ and Pillow,
using the `payload/` folder from the matching release ZIP:

```text
python -m emerald3ds_builder --payload /path/to/payload install --rom /path/to/rom.gba --sd /path/to/card
```

See the [builder documentation](../builder/README.md) for other source-builder commands.
